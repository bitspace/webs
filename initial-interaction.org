* The Initial LLM Interaction
I used [[https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code][Claude Code]]. This document contains my initial prompt and the instructions that Claude displayed after it generated the code artifacts.

** My prompt
Create a web server configuration for the nginx http server. The configuration should be for four domain names: gnarlybob.net, bitspace.org, bitspace.dev, and chriswoods.dev. The configuration for the server should be created in a directory called `etc/nginx-config`. Generate a certbot configuration to generate and retrieve and renew SSL certificates for all four domain names. Additionally, create a simple welcome page for each of the four domain names in a directory called "site-content". The content should use the astro framework. The welcome page for each should be a simple off-white color page with a dark charcoal gray font with a large banner saying "welcome to <domain name>" centered at the top, where "<domain name>" should be replaced by the individual domain name.

** Claude's stdout instructions
1. Created nginx configuration files for all four domains in /etc/nginx-config/:
    - Main config: nginx.conf
    - Domain-specific configs: gnarlybob.net.conf, bitspace.org.conf, bitspace.dev.conf, chriswoods.dev.conf
  2. Created a certbot script (certbot.sh) to generate and renew SSL certificates for all domains.
  3. Set up an Astro project in site-content/ with:
    - A shared layout with off-white background and dark charcoal gray text
    - Welcome pages for each domain with centered banners
    - A main index page with links to each domain-specific page
  4. Added documentation in README.md with setup instructions.
  5. Created a deployment script build-and-deploy.sh to build and deploy the site.

  All files are ready to use. To build and view the site locally, you can run:
  cd site-content
  npm run dev
